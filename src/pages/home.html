    <h1 id="title"><span class="hash">#</span> Hi! I'm Jenny.</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a 3rd-year student at UC San Diego studying math and computer science. 
      I'm currently at <span class="emph2"><a href="https://www.databricks.com/" target="_blank">Databricks</a></span> as a software engineer intern. 
      Previously, I worked at Stripe where I built tools to improve Stripe's multi-region AWS resiliency and General
      Atomics where I worked on a CNN-based deep learning model for ship classification.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I'm currently looking for new grad software engineering positions and off-season internships. Feel free to reach out any time!

        I added features to Stripe's Java testing framework to identify and monitor cross-region AWS API calls, as well as allow developers at Stripe to exempt specific API calls from this cross-region testing to improve resiliency and latency in Stripe's services.

        I extracted, analyzed, and integrated metadata from radar videos into a CNN-based deep learning model for classifying types of ships in the ocean, improving the model's loss by 33% and accuracy by 1.2%. 
        I also automated ML experiment tracking and metadata parsing using MLFlow.
